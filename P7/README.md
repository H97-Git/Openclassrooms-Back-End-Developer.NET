## Getting Started
Clone or download the repository to your local machine to get started. Ensure that you have the necessary tools and frameworks installed to run and develop ASP.NET Core applications.

## Deliverables
* GitHub Repository Link: Link to the entire codebase on GitHub, configured for public access.
## Presentation
During the presentation, you'll provide an overview of your project deliverables and explain the following:

* Improvements made to the existing codebase.
* Implementation details of required elements, including logging, field validations, and testing.
* Challenges encountered during development and how you addressed them.
* Reflections on what could have been done differently.
## Assessment Guidelines
