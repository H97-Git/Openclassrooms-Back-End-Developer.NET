# Lambazon Web Application
Welcome to the Lambazon web application project! This project simulates your first day at Lambazon, an online retailer, where you're tasked with taking over a web application project developed by your colleague, Chris.

## Project Overview
The Lambazon web application is built using the ASP.NET Core framework, designed to facilitate rapid application development. It comprises a couple of web pages and serves as a learning ground for understanding ASP.NET Core and its testing procedures.

## Testing
The project includes xUnit tests to ensure functionality and identify bugs. Simply right-click on the tests and select "Run As -> xUnit Test". A red bar indicates failing tests, while a green bar signifies success.

## Deliverables
### Scenario Deliverables
* Test Execution Reports: Before and after reports of xUnit test executions.
* Completed Code: Zip file containing the completed code.
* GitHub Repository: Link to the private repository with access guidelines.
### Presentation Deliverables
* **Mentor Presentation:** PowerPoint or slide deck covering project details and fixes.
* **Project Presentation**: Oral presentation highlighting discovered issues and their resolutions.
## Assessment Guidelines
