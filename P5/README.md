# The Car Hub Inventory Management Web Application

Welcome to The Car Hub Inventory Management Web Application project! This web application is designed to help Eddie
manage his lot inventory efficiently and securely.

## Project Overview

Eddie, the owner of The Car Hub dealership, requires a web application to manage his inventory, streamline the process
of adding new cars, making changes to listings, and marking cars as sold or unavailable. The application will have a
secure login system to ensure that only Eddie has access to make changes.
